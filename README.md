=========
This is 2 part project done solely by me in the Technion VISL (Vision and Image Science Lab) lab in the Electrical Engineering department. In this project I used OpenCV (http://opencv.org/) - Some prepared opencv skeleton is in use.
As SW student I needed to learn by myself the whole new area for me of computer vision & image detection.
After the theoretical learning phase, I with my mentor set down & tried to implement "Full working Android APP".
The idea was an APP that an track full user head gestures and perform several task on the phone accordingly.
More specific instructions are within the app. In the end I created my own private Google Play user and uploaded the app.
Although I actually never promoted this app (Cause this project done for "academic use"), it`s somehow gained hundreds of downloads from all over the world.

From the pure android point of view this APP demonstrates how I can:
1. Use of the action bar design pattern
2. Good looking UI
3. Some UX effort
4. Developing image detection algorithms within an APP
5. KNOW HOW: Make the full product path - from learning theory to upload a valid APK
